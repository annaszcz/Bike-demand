🔍 Key Questions
1️⃣ How does the number of shared bikes fluctuate hourly? ⏳

Do we see distinct peaks during rush hours?
How do different times of the day impact ridership?
2️⃣ How do bike-sharing trends vary by day of the week? 📅

Are weekends busier than weekdays?
Do workdays follow a consistent pattern?
3️⃣ What are the yearly trends in bike usage? 📈

Is there a steady increase in ridership over time?
Are there seasonal patterns or long-term shifts?
4️⃣ Who are the primary users—members or casual riders? 👥

How does usage differ between subscribers and one-time users?
Are members more active on specific days or seasons?
5️⃣ How does the weather impact bike-sharing? 🌦️

Does temperature, humidity, or windspeed affect ridership?
What weather conditions lead to the highest (or lowest) usage?
🚀 Goal
By answering these questions, I aim to identify patterns, uncover hidden insights, and better understand the dynamics of urban mobility through bike-sharing data.
